# data_labelling
This repository will contain the required functions to label the hits and subsequently voxelize the events and label those voxels.

For now I just have the utils to voxelize/label the MC data, but soon will include the labelling of beersheba data (starting from the MC labelled voxels, I will voxelize beersheba hits and label those voxels using neighbor classes).
