# data_labelling
This repository will contain the required functions to voxelize and label the data

Starting from the cities outputs, the functions will voxelize the detectors space and label the voxels within it. 
For now I just have the utils to label de MC data, but soon I will include the correspondance between hits and their segclass, and also the labelling of beersheba data (with the neighborhooding segmentation classes).
